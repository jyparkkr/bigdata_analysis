## HW1
* MapReduce and Spark - Find potential friends in a social network using Spark
  '''
  From graph of friend in social network, discover potential friends who have many mutual friends.
  We are interested in finding pairs of users who are 1) not friends with each other,
  but 2) have many common friends. For example, if A is a friend of B, B is a friend of C, 
  but A is not a friend of C, then we are interested in the pair (A, C), which has one common friend B.
  '''
* Frequent Itemsets - Find frequent itemsets using the A-Priori algorithm
  '''
  Implement A-Priori algorithm to find frequent items and item pairs in an online browsing dateset.
  To store counts of pairs, use the triangular method with threshold of 200.
  The output should contain number of the top-10 most frequent pairs.
  For ties, sort by first id and then second id in alphabetical order.
  '''
* Finding Similar Items - Find similar documents using minhash-based LSH
  '''
  In very similar articles within a large article set, use minhashed-based LSH algorithm to efficiently find articles that have high Jaccard similarities.
  Extract 3-shingles.
